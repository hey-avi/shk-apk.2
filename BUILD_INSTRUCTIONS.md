# SAHAYAK v2.1 - Android Build Instructions

## Prerequisites

1. **Install EAS CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Expo account**:
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. **Configure EAS project** (if first time):
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

## Build Commands

### Development Build (for testing)
```bash
npm run build:android:dev
```
This creates a development client APK that you can install on your device for testing.

### Preview Build (APK for distribution)
```bash
npm run build:android:preview
```
This creates an APK file that you can share or sideload on Android devices.

### Production Build (App Bundle for Play Store)
```bash
npm run build:android
```
This creates an AAB (Android App Bundle) file for Google Play Store submission.

## Manual Build Commands

If you prefer to use EAS CLI directly:

```bash
# Development build
eas build --platform android --profile development

# Preview APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Production App Bundle
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## Build Configuration

The app is configured with:
- **App Name**: Sahayak
- **Version**: 2.1.0 (versionCode: 2)
- **Package**: com.sahayak.emergency
- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
- **Compile SDK**: 34

## Required Permissions

The app requests the following critical permissions for emergency functionality:
- Location access (fine and background)
- Phone calling
- Camera and audio recording
- Bluetooth and WiFi for mesh networking
- Notifications and foreground services
- Network and storage access

## Post-Build Steps

1. **Download the build** from the EAS console or use:
   ```bash
   eas build:list
   ```

2. **Install APK** on Android device:
   ```bash
   adb install sahayak-v2.1.apk
   ```

3. **Test emergency features**:
   - Location permissions
   - Phone calling capability
   - Bluetooth mesh network
   - Offline SOS functionality

## Signing Configuration

For production builds, you may need to configure app signing:

```bash
eas credentials
```

Follow the prompts to set up keystore and signing certificates.

## Troubleshooting

### App Crashes on First Launch

**Problem**: App crashes immediately when opened for the first time.

**Solution**: 
1. **Clear app data**: Go to Android Settings > Apps > Sahayak > Storage > Clear Data
2. **Enable permissions BEFORE opening**: Go to Android Settings > Apps > Sahayak > Permissions
3. **Grant all permissions**:
   - Location (Allow all the time)
   - Phone 
   - Camera
   - Microphone
   - Nearby devices/Bluetooth
   - Notifications
4. **Then open the app** - it should work without crashing

**Why this happens**: The app tries to initialize Bluetooth and location services immediately, but crashes if permissions aren't granted first.

### Mesh Network Showing Fake Devices

**Problem**: App shows "SAHAYAK User 1", "SAHAYAK User 2" etc. instead of real devices.

**How to check**:
- Look at the "Discovery Status" section in the mesh network panel
- If it shows "ðŸŸ¡ SIMULATED (Demo)" - these are fake devices for testing
- If it shows "ðŸ”µ REAL Bluetooth" - these are actual nearby SAHAYAK devices

**To get real devices**:
1. Ensure Bluetooth permissions are granted
2. Turn on Bluetooth on your device
3. Install the app on multiple Android devices nearby
4. All devices should have the same app version and Bluetooth enabled

### Other Issues

- If build fails due to permissions, check that all required permissions are properly declared
- For Bluetooth issues, ensure target SDK is properly configured
- For location issues, verify background location permission is included
